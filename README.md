# StackStorm Lint Configs

This repository contains lint configs for different programming languages and
tools (flake8, pylint, etc.) used by different StackStorm repositories.

Configs are grouped in sub-directories by programming language.

To use those configs, add this repository as a git subtree / submodule to the
